## Proposal

## Questions

* Should the widgets be of fixed size or do we have a grid where a widget can fill 1x1, 2x1, or whatever number of cells?

Current thinking for MVP is no due to complexities of ordering/adjusting for different screen resolutions.

* Can we rearrange the widgets?

For an MVP I don't think so, but it's definitely something that'd be interesting for the future.

* Can we customize the appearance (order, visibility, size, color)?

Yes to all of the above.

Developers should be able to define priorities for their cards, e.g. the pipeline graph view or console would probably take highest priority.

Visibility, size and color should all be customizable too - e.g. the console view could follow your text editor theme.

* Does the layout adapt to different screen sizes automatically?

Yes, cards and their contents should scale to different screen sizes.
